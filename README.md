## React Hooks Library

A collection of custom React hooks to simplify common tasks in React applications.
Because this project includes examples, it has React and ReactDOM as regular dependencies.
The library part of this project specifies React and ReactDOM as peer dependencies. This package is
not published to npm but if someone were to use this hooks library in their own project, they would need to have React and ReactDOM installed.


## Getting Started

1. Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js v18 or latest installed
2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server locally
4. Run `npm run examples` to see the examples
